# Setup

1. Within the `/frontend` directory, run `npm install` to install the required dependencies
2. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server at `localhost:5173`

(Note) - The stock performance chart on the "Why" page will not work. It uses a personal API running in a docker container on my machine. I can point it to the production API if there is interest, but currently I am not.

## TODO

-   Edit scrollbar
-   Search on stock ticker "Why" page
